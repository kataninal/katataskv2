This is not the end,
This is not the beginning,
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violent rhythm,
Though the words sound steady,
Something empty’s within 'em,
We’re fists fighting up in the air,
Like we’re holding onto something
That’s invisible there,
'Cause we’re living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it,
Let it all disappear.
Waiting for the end to come…
Wishing I had strength to stand…
This is not what I had planned…
It’s out of my control…
Flying at the speed of light,
Thoughts were spinning in my head.
So many things were left unsaid.
It’s hard to let you go…
I know how it feels to lie,
